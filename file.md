Alright so I will like us to be flexible with time and scheduling
I don't know where you are 

But most times i receive pay directly into my mobile wallet, either through crypto or through apps like remitly, sendwave or other apps

But crypto is very much preferred, just depends on what's best for you

Unfortunately paypal is not accepted in Cameroon

And we can schedule directly through platforms like google meet âœ…

We can also chat on whatsap ( +237681610898)  if you have that) or skype
